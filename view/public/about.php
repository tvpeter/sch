									<h3>OUR HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h3>
									
									<div>
						<p>St. Catherine’s College Ogoja derived its name from the famous St. Catherine’s College of Catering and Hotel Management in Ireland. It started at Abakpa, Ogoja as St. Catherine’s institute (Centre for women education) offering many courses on hotel management, house wife training, housekeeping, cake making as well as food production services and processing.</p><p> The institution was established in September 1994 by the Catholic Diocese of Ogoja with Rev. sister Anthoniette K. Mensah as its first Principal. As students population continued to increase and the need for circular secondary education evolved, students were admitted for the pure secondary education alongside the catering students. The college sought for and received approval from the Cross River state Ministry of Education in 1995.</p>

						<p>Following students progression, the college applied for and got formal approval for Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination Council (WAEC) in 1999 to offer both arts and core science subjects. The college successfully enrolled students for May/June 2000 (WAEC) and (NECO) Examinations. As enrolled soon the facilities became over stretched and the college seeks the Bishop’s approval and moved to Igoli, Ogoja in 2011 where it is situated till date. The college programmes cater for people of diverse background, tribe, sex, religion and colour without discrimination.</p>
