							<h4 style="color:#000;"><strong>Admission Process</strong></h4>
							<p style="color:#000;">St. Catherineâ€™s College Ogoja is open to all eligible candidates irrespective of tribe, nationality or religion. However, once admitted, the students are bound to adhere to the Catholic tradition of the school while they are in session. To be eligible for admission into Junior Secondary One (JS 1), the candidate must have completed his/her primary education and have also passed the Common Entrance Examination conducted by the State Ministry of Education. The school follows a uniform admission procedure as organized by the Ogoja Diocesan Education Board. Forms for intended candidates are usually on sale from the months of May and June when the Ogoja Diocesan Education Board Entrance Examination is conducted. Forms can be purchased directly from the school.</p>
